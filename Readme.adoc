== Abstract

An experiment using a link:https://graphql.org[GraphQL] backend in Java link:https://spring.io[Spring] exposing a generic searchable/aggregable API.
Apart from learning purposes, the goal is to evaluate the graphql state-of-art in Java with required features as _look-ahead_ and _dataloader_ optimizations.

== Development Guide

Some development docs link:./docs/dev-guide.adoc[here].

== Warm & Run

```bash
mvn compile
mvn test

mvn spring-boot:run
```

=== Dockerize

By executing:
[source,bash]
```
mvn package
```

A docker image named _springboot-graphql-song_ and tagged with current commit time and commit id abbreviated, for examples:

```
$ docker images
REPOSITORY                  TAG                           IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
springboot-graphql-song     2020-05-28T17-23-36.1f4f5d6   a6d8cce143aa        9 minutes ago       430MB
```

Finally an instance could be started by:

```
docker run -ti --rm --name graphql-song -p 8080:8080 springboot-graphql-song:2020-05-28T17-31-30.1f4f5d6
```

=== The Holy Grail

It is pending trying to run it using link:https://spring.io/blog/2020/04/16/spring-tips-the-graalvm-native-image-builder-feature[Graalvm].
